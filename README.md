## Building in Public

We ship incrementally and share progress. The app is live; features evolve based on user feedback and on-chain usage. No secrets or internal build details here—just enough to show we're building and to welcome contributors.

## Get Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
